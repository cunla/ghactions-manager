<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin creates a toolbar on JetBrains products (IntelliJ, PyCharm, ...) 
where you can view GitHub workflow runs of the repository.
This plugin is a good alternative to alt-tabbing for every time you push 
some changes to the branch and want to see whether the repository's checks 
are passing on your changes.
